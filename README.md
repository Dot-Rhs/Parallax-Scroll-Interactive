# Parallax-Scroll-Interactive
A small test of the canvas API to create a parallax scrolling background with small added features

## Running the parallax scrolling test
If you open the index.html page directly you are likely to run into CORS errors, so currently the easiest way to run this is opening via live server, everything else is not worth the effort (for this project).

## Completed tasks
- Added scroll by canvas click position
- Added scroll by tracking mouse cursor relative to canvas
- Added scroll by mouse cursor speed (May change to click and drag speed)

## TODO
- Add custom artwork and replace placeholders
- Add some small vertical scrolling
- Add user defined scroll speed
- Style the radio boxess
